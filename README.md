A comprehensive data science project analyzing global temperature trends and building predictive models to understand climate change patterns. This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow from data exploration to model deployment for climate science.

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time. This project uses historical temperature data and machine learning to:

Analyze global warming trends since 1850

Build predictive models for temperature forecasting

Identify key climate change indicators

Provide data-driven insights for environmental research
